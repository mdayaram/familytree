TODO:
Inspired by https://github.com/adrienverge/familytreemaker
* Text format for family tree, makes it easier to mentally parse.
* Translate code to either current JS family tree or GraphViz
* https://gojs.net/latest/samples/genogram.html

Would use familytreemaker itself, but there's some bugs with having multiple
top level ancestors.

If using graphviz; to convert output to an SVG.
Different layouts: https://graphviz.org/docs/layouts/osage/
